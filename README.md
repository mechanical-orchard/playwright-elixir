**NOTE:** This package is currently in "preview". The features are not yet at parity with other Playwright implementations. Once `playwright-elixir` is at or near parity with [`playwright`](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright), the version number will be updated to mirror the supported version of `playwright`.

## Overview

[Playwright](https://github.com/mechanical-orchard/playwright-elixir) is an Elixir library to automate Chromium, Firefox and WebKit with a single API. Playwright is built to enable cross-browser web automation that is **ever-green**, **capable**, **reliable** and **fast**. [See how Playwright is better](https://playwright.dev/docs/why-playwright).

## Installation

The package can be installed by adding `playwright` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
